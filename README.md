# Analyzing-Loan-Data-from-Prosper
This dataset is financial dataset and this is related to the loan, borrowers, lenders, interest rates and stuffs like that. Prosper or Prosper Marketplace Inc. is a San Francisco, California based company specializing in loans at low interest rates to the borrowers. In this dataset, we are using the data from the Posper to analyse it and trying to find the pattern in the Prosper data. This may be tedious because of the sheer size of the dataset and the complicated nature of all the financial datasets. We are using Python libraries to plot some visualizations.
